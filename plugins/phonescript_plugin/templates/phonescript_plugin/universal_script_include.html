<h3>Universal Scripts</h3>

<p>These scripts will be shown to everyone viewing your action.  For each script,
  select one or more representatives to be paired with the script.  For instance, if you
  write a script and select Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, people will see two additional
  phone actions, one for Ryan and one for McConnell.</p>

<p>You can use multiple universal scripts.  Just be careful not to select the same representatives
  for each script.  If you do, one of the options will be selected for that representative at
  random.</p>
