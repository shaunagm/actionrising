<h3>Constituent Scripts</h3>
<p>Based on the location data they've provided, users will get up to three scripts
  for their Senators and representatives.  For instance, let's say a user is from
  MA-7.  We'll identify their representatives as Sen. Warren, Sen. Markey and Rep. Capuano.
  For each of these, we check the conditional scripts to see if any match.
  If one of your scripts says, "Use this script for all Senators", we'll provide it for
  Warren and Markey but not Capuano.</p>
<p>If a representative matches more than one script, we look at the 'priority' field to
  determine which to show for that rep.  If a representative doesn't match any scripts,
  we won't show anything for that rep, unless you provide a "default" script to use as
  a backup.</p>
