## What should I know before I get started?

### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to the maintainers.

### ActionRising and Packages

ActionRising is an open source project to help communities share information
and coordinate helpful action within their community.

ActionRising is developed using Django.

### Design Decisions

When we make a significant decision in how we maintain the project and what
we can or cannot support, we will document it in the
[ActionRising repository](https://github.com/shaunagm/actionrising). If you
have a question around how we do things, check to see if it is documented
there. If it is *not* documented there, please open a new issue and ask your
question.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for ActionRising.
Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand
your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find
related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report)
as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are
creating a bug report, please
[include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). 
Fill out an issue report as thoroughly as possible.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the documentation.** You might be able to find the cause of the
problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce
the problem in the latest version of ActionRising

* **Perform a search of the issues** to see if the problem has already been
reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a
new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
Create an issue on the ActionRising repository.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers
reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details
  as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started ActionRising,
  e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started
  otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain
  how you did it**
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to
  files, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If
  you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point
  out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the
  described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If you're reporting that ActionRising crashed**, include a crash report
  with a stack trace from the operating system.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you
  were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the
  guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Can you reproduce the problem?**
* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new
  version of ActionRising) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem
  in an older version of ActionRising?** What's the most recent version in
  which the problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how
  often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files),
  **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?** Does
  the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on
  network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or
  Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files
  in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you
  are using?

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Which packages do you have installed?** You can get that list by running
  `pip list`.

### Suggesting Enhancements

ActionRising, including completely new features and minor improvements to

[this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find
out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement
suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion).
Fill in an issue, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the
feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Check the documentation** for tips â€” you might discover that the enhancement
  is already available.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Aactionrising)**
  to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a
  comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
